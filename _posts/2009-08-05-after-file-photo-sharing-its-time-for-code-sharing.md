If we want to share a file or photos while chatting with our friends on internet using IM tools like GTalk, we use file sharing services available online. These services allow us to upload a file to their servers and give us a link which we can share with our friends. But what if you are a developer and want to share a small piece of code with your friend? You are left with following choices:

  * **Paste it in your chat:** I know most of us do this when we quickly want to share the code. However, its annoying as it becomes unreadable and makes your code look as if its obfuscated<img src="http://anaykamat.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 

  * **Email:** This approach is better compared to previous approach, however the recipient wil need to manually compile the code and run it if he wants to know the output.

I won&#8217;t say these approaches are useless. But I would like to have a place, where I can put my code fragment and then share it using a link. I can use this link in my gtalk status, chat or even in twitter posts.

Luckily, there is a site called &#8220;[codepad](http://codepad.org/)&#8221; that allows us to do exactly the same thing. It allows us to share a piece of code using a small url.

You can try it now at &#8220;<a href="http://codepad.org/" target="_blank">http://codepad.org/</a>&#8221; or take a look at this example code posted by me at &#8220;<a href="http://codepad.org/XZpSNngW" target="_blank">http://codepad.org/XZpSNngW</a>&#8221;

Finally, one thing I would like to see is support for C# code.
