This is the second story in the &#8220;Mistake Or No Mistake&#8221; series (You can read the first part [here](http://anaykamat.com/2013/01/10/mistake-or-no-mistake-part-1/)). While this story might be the simplest in the entire series, it forms the base for the conclusions that we would make at the end of this series.

Mr. Vijay Gupta, a senior software manager in a reputed production company, is walking towards his office. He was slightly late today so he was trying to walk as fast as he could. As usual, he was dressed in formals and was carrying his laptop. Suddenly, while walking on the foot-path, he slips over banana peel and falls down. Ooooops!!

Now, coming back to our question, who do you feel was at fault here? Was there any mistake from Vijay&#8217;s end or did he pay for mistake from someone else?
