Today our training at TW University got over. After six weeks of training which included games, lot of fun filled activities, role plays and lots of things other than boring lectures and classroom hours, the training got over &#8220;JUST LIKE THAT&#8221;.

This was our project week, where all trainers acted like customers and ut we had to apply all our skills that we developed over these six weeks in delivering a solution to them. Today was our last day and soon after final showcase&#8230;. there was end of this TWU.

But wait!!! Though university had ended, fun didn&#8217;t. We had our so called &#8220;Graduation Ceremony&#8221; where our trainers gave us certificates. Coooool isn&#8217;t it?

Now, from monday onwards, we will be coming to office as regular employees. In front of us, we have new opportunities, new challenges and new vision. And to tell you, we all are excited to explore those opportunities.

Finally, I would like to say, &#8220;LONG LIVE TWU&#8221;. Indeed its totally different from any other training I&#8217;ve experienced so far.
