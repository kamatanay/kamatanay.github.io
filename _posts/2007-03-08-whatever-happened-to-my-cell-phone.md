In my company, everyday we have standups. In standups, whole team stands in a circle and each team member speaks about what he did yesterday and what he will be doing today.

But for last three days, during my team&#8217;s standup, my phone rings just before my turn. I always receive some or other sms just before my turn to speak and it rings loudly. Today, our standup got delayed by some 15 minutes and I thought, &#8220;Cool, I hope it won&#8217;t ring today&#8221;. But again, it rang just before I was about to speak.
