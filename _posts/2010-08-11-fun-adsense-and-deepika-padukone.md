Yesterday I was reading an article on &#8220;How to Uninstall Symantec AntiVirus&#8221;. The article was from EzineArticles. While reading it, I suddenly noticed that the AdSense block is showing a complete unrelated ad on the page. Take a look at the screen-shot below.

For those who don&#8217;t know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepika_Padukone" target="_blank">Deepika Padukone</a> is a bollywood actress. The article I was reading was related to removing a software (Symantec Antivirus) which was not related to film industry or actors in any context.

I found this quite funny and thought of sharing it. Do you find it interesting as well? Let me know your thoughts through comments.

Enjoy!!!
