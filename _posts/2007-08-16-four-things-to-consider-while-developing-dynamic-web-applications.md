These days, there is a trend of developing dynamic web applications using server side and client side scripting languages. If you are thinking of putting up a website, it is highly possible that you are thinking about making it dynamic and interactive. If you are thinking of developing your dynamic web application right from scratch, you should be putting your attention to factors such as scripting language, cost, type of hosting etc. This article will introduce you to four factors to consider before starting your development on dynamic web application.

There are lots of scripting languages like PHP, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET etc which you can use to develop your web application. Also, database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS-SQL etc are also available. Rather than just picking up a language from the list and using it, think about platform compatibility of your scripting language and database management system that you are planning to use. If your language and database management system could be used on any hosting platform (Windows or Linux), than it will be easier for you to move between hosts and even between platforms if required. For example, PHP could be easily used on Windows as well as Linux, but you can run ASP.NET application only on Windows server. Once you have decided which language to use, you need to consider the cost of hosting your application.

If you search on the net, you will find many web hosting companies providing lot of unique features. Compare the features provided by them as well as cost of each hosting plan. Select the plan which suits your application the best. That is, you should get enough disk space and your host should support your scripting language. Compare their prices and decide who shall host your site. But there are different types of web hosting.

Some of the hosts will offer you different types of hosting. These include shared hosting and dedicated hosting. Shared hosting is cheaper than dedicated hosting. For any small scale web application like a blog or a small ecommerce shop, shared hosting will be the best option. However, if you want total control over your hosting while supporting lot of visitors and CPU intensive tasks, than dedicated hosting will be best for you. But the most important of all is support which is provided by your web hosting company.

Imagine that your host gives you large disk space and good support for various scripting languages at a very good price, but poor customer support. In this case, all of a sudden if your email stops working or you need to install SSL certificate urgently, you will end up in trouble as you wonâ€™t get prompt support from your hosting company. Your host should give you a good 24/7 support and 99% uptime. This will ensure that your site will always be available to the users and problems could be solved quickly.

Many websites created these days are dynamic and interactive. Such websites could be maintained easily compared to static websites. If you are thinking of putting up a dynamic website or converting your static website to dynamic website, than considering elements like platform compatibility of your scripting language, cost of hosting, type of hosting and support will ensure that your site runs smoothly without any hassles.
