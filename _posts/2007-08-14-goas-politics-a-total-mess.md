Since independence, Goa&#8217;s politics has remained quite unstable. Having a list of 19 chief ministers in last twenty years clearly proves that fact (Considering one chief minister every 5 years, there should have been around 4 chief ministers).

Looking at the recent political happenings, it seems as there won&#8217;t be any political stability in Goa. Some MLA&#8217;s who had earlier given support to the ruling party, suddenly declared that they are withdrawing their support. They joined hands with opposition leaving the ruling party to minority. Government was told to prove its majority.

Looking at the numbers, it was clear that the ruling party was indeed in minority. However, government kept saying that they are still in majority. This was clearly, a nice attempt to fool people. While everybody was thinking over this number game, something strange took place in Assembly during vote of confidence.

Just before vote of confidence took place, Speaker restrained three MLA&#8217;s who supported opposition from voting. This made the number of opposition members equal to members of ruling party. Speaker (Who is a member of ruling party) voted in favour of ruling party. In this way, speaker saved the government. Chief minister was happy to say that he has won the number game. It was very clear that ruling party would now need speakers vote every time, to run the government.

Opposition took this issue to supreme court. However, after some days there took place another political drama. One MLA declared that he would again join the ruling party. What a mess&#8230; Right?

Let me make it clear, that I&#8217;m not talking in favour of any party. But the incident&#8217;s clearly showed how political parties are interested only in winning seats. They are least bothered about the welfare of people in state. Who is going to solve the problem of illiteracy? Who is going to solve the problem of unemployment? There are many more problems to list. Before elections, everybody claims that they are going to solve these issues. But do they have time to care about these issues, when they are so busy in playing their number game.
