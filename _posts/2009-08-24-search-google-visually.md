Today I came across an online tool that allows you to see the screenshot of pages in the google search result. You can give it a try at &#8220;<a href="http://veesual.com" target="_blank">Veesual.com</a>&#8221;

<a rel="attachment wp-att-91" href="http://anaykamat.com/2009/08/24/search-google-visually/veesual/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-91" title="Veesual" src="http://anaykamat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Veesual-300x162.png" alt="Veesual" width="300" height="162" /></a>

<a rel="attachment wp-att-92" href="http://anaykamat.com/2009/08/24/search-google-visually/veesualresult/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-92" title="Veesual Result" src="http://anaykamat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/VeesualResult-300x131.png" alt="Veesual Result" width="300" height="131" srcset="http://anaykamat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/VeesualResult-300x131.png 300w, http://anaykamat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/VeesualResult-1024x447.png 1024w, http://anaykamat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/VeesualResult.png 1415w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>

While I found the concept to be interesting, I was wondering what could be the use of looking at screenshots of pages in search result. What matters to me is getting a list of relevant search results. A thumbnail of a particular page in search result won&#8217;t help me in determining how relevant that page is to my search.

However, I do see one use for getting search results along with thumbnails. It can be used to come up with ideas for designing web-sites for a particular theme. You can search on Veesual using a keyword that describes the theme of your site and then take a quick look at the design of pages in the result. This can help you to come up with your own web-page design.

Do let me know if you can think of some more applications of <a href="http://veesual.com" target="_blank">Veesual.com</a>
