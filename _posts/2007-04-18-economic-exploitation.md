Before I go ahead with this post, let me quote the dictionary meaning of the word economic exploitation :

> Most often, the word _exploitation_ is used to refer to economic exploitation; that is, the act of using another person&#8217;s labor without offering them an adequate compensation. (http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/exploitation)

After reading this, you might say, &#8220;Oh yes, we know about this. This is how poor and uneducated people get exploited&#8221;. If you also think similarly than you are wrong. There are many educated people who get exploited too.

One company in Bangalore, hires freshers (as software developers) and pays them as less as Rs. 3000 per month during training. All this for the full time training. That is 10:00 am till 8:00 pm. <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Trainees</span> need to manage their food, shelter and all the basic needs in this amount for the full month in a city like <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Bangalore</span> (What the hell&#8230;.). Can you believe this?

The story is not over yet. The company once decided to organise an internal event for which they collected Rs.50 from all the trainees. When one of them raised a voice, saying that for him its not possible to pay as his full salary goes in satisfying all his basic needs, the trainer <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">advised</span> him to ask for money from his friends. My doubt is, whether this company teaches people to do their job or to beg?

When the question is raised over the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected">initial</span> salary(?), the management says, &#8220;we employed you when any other company didn&#8217;t recruit you&#8221;.

What I can&#8217;t understand is, why do people fall for such kind of exploitation. Why no one opposes it? But for those who don&#8217;t like to get exploited, be careful from such companies.
