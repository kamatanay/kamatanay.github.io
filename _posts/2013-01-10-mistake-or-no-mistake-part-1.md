Long back, we were told a story about a man who goes to jungle for adventure. The story was more like a question to make us think and force us to enquire.

Once upon a time, there was a doctor who used to enjoy making regular trips to a nearby jungle for adventure and studies. However, on his 100th visit to the jungle, something happened.

That day, he left for jungle early in the morning. There was nothing new here as, he always used to leave early for his jungle/study trip. With him, he had carried all usual stuffs like first aid, communication devise, camera and binoculars. Soon, he was deep inside the jungle.

Though he had visited this area before, on that day, he noticed a tiger in that area. The tiger was lying down near the river. The moment the doctor noticed the tiger, he got scared and cried for help. As a result, tiger got up and started staring at the doctor. The doctor, in order to save his life, started running as fast as he could.

Next day, police found his dead body in jungle&#8230;.

The story ends here. We were then asked a very important question, &#8220;Who do you think was at fault? Do you think it was Doctor&#8217;s mistake? Was there a mistake or no mistake?&#8221;.

When we heard the story for the first time, we were so much disturbed that our first reaction was, &#8220;No, Doctor didn&#8217;t commit any mistake&#8221;. However, as we enquired further, we learnt a very important lesson.

I would like to ask the same question to all the readers of this blog post. Who do you think was at fault? Do you think it was Doctor&#8217;s mistake? Was there a mistake or no mistake? Kindly reply through comments.
