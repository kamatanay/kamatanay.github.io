Hello Everyone,

My name is Anay Narendra Kamat and I am from Goa, India. I am currently working as Consultant/Co-Founder at <a title="PresentSoft Technologies Pvt. Ltd." href="http://www.presentsoft.co.in" target="_blank">PresentSoft Technologies Pvt. Ltd</a>.

At PresentSoft Technologies, we try to make use of open source technologies and lean/agile practices to achieve rapid software development.

I have around 7 years of experience in delivering scalable enterprise applications using technologies like Ruby (RoR/Sinatra/Middleman), Javascript (NodeJS), Java, Groovy (Grails) and C#. I have been following Agile practices since the beginning of my career.

That doesn&#8217;t mean I spend all my time in front of my PC. I like to read books and blogs related to Technology and Religion (I know it sounds like an odd combination), watch TV and get involved in some social activities as well.
